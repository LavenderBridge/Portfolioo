        You might be wondering why this website looks like the way it does. Well that might be partly due to the fact that except for some minimal CSS for alignment and colors, this website is purely HTML. This was a choice taken by me due to the fact that I absolutely love such minimal no-nonsense designs. I like to keep it plain and simple. In the near future I will be integrating some JS as well but the overall look of the website is going ot remain pretty much exactly the same stylistically
